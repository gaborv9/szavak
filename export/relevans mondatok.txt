What is the ask?	"<br><br>ask (as a noun) = request<br>Raymond Chen - This has taken over Microsoft-speak in the past year or so and it drives me batty. ""What are our key asks here?"", you might hear in a meeting. Language tip: The thing you are asking for is called a ""request"". Plus, of course, the thing that is an ""ask"" is usually more of a ""demand"" or ""requirement"". But those are such unfriendly words, aren't they? Why not use a warm, fuzzy word like ""ask"" to take the edge off? Answer: Because it's not a word. These ""asks"" are really ""demands"". So don't guilt-trip me with ""Oh, you didn't meet our ask. We had to cut half our features. But that's okay. We'll just suffer quietly, you go do your thing, don't mind us."" Martha - I don't care how old the usage is, 'ask' as a noun is just... wrong.

I'll finish the report before the meeting. Vs I'll finish the report beforehand = in advance.	"<br><br>before vs beforehand = in advance<br>I'm actually having a difficult time explaining beforehand simply because it isn't often used in everyday language. I think the best way to understand it is something like: beforehand is a way to avoid using a prepositional phrase. For example, you could state:<br><br>They both have the same meaning and I don't detect any significant difference in nuance. However, the second would only be stated if it is clear that you are talking about a meeting (because it was discussed earlier).<br><br>Also, I'm not confident if this sensation is shared, but I believe that beforehand sounds slightly lazy (and consequently a little less formal). It sounds like you are sacrificing explicitness and clarity for ease.<br><br>In advance is a bit easier to understand. In advance always implies that you are doing something earlier than absolutely necessary.<br>előtte vs előre<br><br>In my experience (native American English speaker), the word beforehand is not really used as it is typically defined.

collect vs gather	"<br><br>collect vs gather<br>Collect X basically implies you will keep or contain X after obtaining X. Gather X may not necessarily have this implication, you usually have to express it or suggest it via context. Because we usually don't force people against their will or put them in containers, gather is often used with people, unless we are transporting them. If the X's you are wanting to aggregate exist over a wide area, gather helps to suggest that. Using collect in this situation implies there is only a few or exact known number of X. Collect X can also mean ""to keep X as part of a collection"" or ""to receive something as payment, especially to repay a debt.""<br>gyűjt<br><br>We are gathered here today to talk about the monorail.<br>I've collected a few people and they are ready [sounds like the people aren't real people, but a manager may say this in treating people as resources]<br>This device gathers rainwater [implying rainwater flows through it]<br>This device collects rainwater [when it's done raining, the water stays]<br>We walked around the plains and gathered berries.<br>We walked around the plains and collected berries [these must have been some special berries.]"

Whose fires need replenishing? vs. Which fires’ fuel needs replenishing?	"<br><br>whose<br>I just realized that whose is used in several different grammatical ways. In some of these ways, I would never use whose for anything but a person or animal. In particular, one of whose's uses is as an interrogative pronoun, as in: Whose shoes are these? Whose are these shoes? If you had some leaves, and were asking which tree they fell off of, you cannot say: *Whose leaves are these? *Whose are these leaves? You have to say something like: Which tree's leaves are these? But when it is a relative pronoun that immediately follows its antecedant, whose can be used for inanimate objects: The tree whose leaves look like hands .... This may be part of the cause of the confusion about whether whose can only be used for people or animals.<br>akié, amié, kié, mié<br><br>""Whose"" is also used to refer to a component of something inanimate and your original is perfectly grammatical. I wonder if you're inventing a problem where there isn't one. If you think using ""whose"" sounds a bit too formal, you could say e.g. ""A camera with wires going through the wall"", which would maybe be what people would say in everyday spontaneous speech. It's not clear to me that ""a camera of which the wires..."" is more common or natural than ""a camera whose wires..."".<br><br>As far as grammatical category is concerned, it really depends on your model and, depending on your model, exactly what type of analysis you're doing. As a fairly broad label, it's probably fair to group it with other ""wh-words"" (""when"", ""which"" etc.)."

When you say ""I'm not sure"", other people might think that you have the idea about something but you are uncertain how would you validate or verify it.  When you say ""I don't know"", other people might think that you don't have the idea about something. Sometimes, saying this might raise ignorance to other people (directly or not) and saying this has more negative weight of aura towards others.  So therefore, some people say ""I'm not sure"" rather than ""I don't know"" so that they can tell other people that they're aware about something (especially when being asked).<br>nem tudom<br><br>"

I'm sorry for/about yesterday.	<br><br>to be sorry about sg vs to be sorry for sg<br>So to sum up, it largely depends on two things, how specific the apology is (with 'for' being for the very specific), and how much responsibility you take (with 'for' implying greater personal responsibility).  Given just those two option (there are others, such as 'I'm sorry that...) it depends on what you want to apologise for.  To take two extremes, if it is something very specific, like arriving late for an appointment, you might say 'I'm sorry for being late', or 'Sorry I'm late'. It would be unusual to say 'Sorry about being late'  If it is that you want to apologise more generally for some arrangements that have gone completely haywire, you might say 'I'm sorry about the shambles on Thursday'. You could also possibly say 'I'm sorry for the shambles on Thursday'. Using 'for' in this case does suggest very slightly your taking more responsibility for what happened than if you said 'Sorry about the shambles'. The latter could just mean that you are sorry it happened, but don't take too much responsibility.<br>bocsánatot kér vmiért<br><br>I'm sorry for/about my bad English.<br>I'm sorry for/about that.
