I'll finish the report before the meeting. Vs I'll finish the report beforehand = in advance.	"before vs beforehand = in advance I'm actually having a difficult time explaining beforehand simply because it isn't often used in everyday language. I think the best way to understand it is something like: beforehand is a way to avoid using a prepositional phrase. For example, you could state: They both have the same meaning and I don't detect any significant difference in nuance. However, the second would only be stated if it is clear that you are talking about a meeting (because it was discussed earlier).

Whose fires need replenishing? vs. Which fires’ fuel needs replenishing?	"whose I just realized that whose is used in several different grammatical ways. In some of these ways, I would never use whose for anything but a person or animal. In particular, one of whose's uses is as an interrogative pronoun, as in: Whose shoes are these? Whose are these shoes? If you had some leaves, and were asking which tree they fell off of, you cannot say: *Whose leaves are these? *Whose are these leaves? You have to say something like: Which tree's leaves are these? But when it is a relative pronoun that immediately follows its antecedant, whose can be used for inanimate objects: The tree whose leaves look like hands .... This may be part of the cause of the confusion about whether whose can only be used for people or animals. akié, amié, kié, mié ""Whose"" is also used to refer to a component of something inanimate and your original is perfectly grammatical. I wonder if you're inventing a problem where there isn't one. If you think using ""whose"" sounds a bit too formal, you could say e.g. ""A camera with wires going through the wall"", which would maybe be what people would say in everyday spontaneous speech. It's not clear to me that ""a camera of which the wires..."" is more common or natural than ""a camera whose wires..."". As far as grammatical category is concerned, it really depends on your model and, depending on your model, exactly what type of analysis you're doing. As a fairly broad label, it's probably fair to group it with other ""wh-words"" (""when"", ""which"" etc.)."
